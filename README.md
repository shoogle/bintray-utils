# bintray-utils
Scripts to simplify the task of managing repositories hosted on
[Bintray](https://bintray.com/) via the command line. Useful as part of an
automated deployment process.

## Scripts:

* `bintray-tidy.sh` - delete old versions from a bintray package

Contributions welcome via pull requests. Please follow the coding style used by
the existing files in the project. If creating a new file, please use
`bintray-tidy.sh` as a template.

## Ideas list:

* `bintray-upload.sh` - upload a file to a specified Bintray repo/package/version.
* `bintray-package.sh` - create a new package on Bintray, or return information
    about an existing one.
